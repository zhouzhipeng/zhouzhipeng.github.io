Sometimes we often need to upload or download small files on a Linux machine. At this time, the usual practice is to open a `ftp` software for transmission, but sometimes it is more troublesome. Generally, another good way is to use The `rz` `sz` command is uploaded or downloaded directly.

The following actions are demonstrated in `SecureCRT`:

## Download and install rzsz (step by step)

```bash

# 1. Download the rzsz installation package
Wget https://ohse.de/uwe/releases/lrzsz-0.12.20.tar.gz

# 2. Unzip
Tar zxvf lrzsz-0.12.20.tar.gz &amp;&amp; cd lrzsz-0.12.20

# 3. Compile and install
./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install

# 4. Create a soft chain
Ln -s /usr/local/bin/lrz /usr/local/bin/rz
Ln -s /usr/local/bin/lsz /usr/local/bin/sz

```
